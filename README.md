# robot-demos
Demos. From my Robots talk

## Phone app
There's an Android phone app (android_controller). It's a bare-minimum UI and 'connect to bluetooth serial' thing. I've made zero effort to make anything tidy, generic or current (I'm using at least one deprecated API) but it works for me.

## Arduino
I originally wrote the talk and demos based on the Arduino UNO. I've kept the arduino code for the skid control robot in case someone finds it useful.

## MicroPython
Some of the folks I give this talk to are new to programming. Python is definitely easier than C/C++ so I also target MicroPython on the Raspberry Pi Pico. This will likely work unmodified or almost unmodified on other rpi2040 based boards. I've not tested, though.
